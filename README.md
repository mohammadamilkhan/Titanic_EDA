# Project Report: Titanic Dataset EDA

## Objective:
The aim of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset to identify key patterns and features that influenced passenger survival during the shipwreck.

## Steps Undertaken:

### 1. Data Loading and Understanding
- Loaded dataset from Kaggle input files.
- Explored structure, data types, and summary statistics using `.info()` and `.describe()`.

### 2. Missing Value Analysis
- Visualized missing data using a heatmap.
- Identified missing values in features like `Age` and `Cabin`.

### 3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Examined distributions of categorical features (`Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`).
- Visualized survival rates by gender, class, and age using bar plots and histograms.

### 4. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Imputed missing values.
- Created new features or transformed existing ones for better analysis.

### 5. Model Building (Random Forest)
- Implemented Random Forest Classifier to predict survival.
- Evaluated the model's accuracy and feature importance.

## Conclusion :
The EDA revealed that passenger class, gender, and age were strong indicators of survival.  
Women and children had significantly higher survival rates.  
The Random Forest model achieved a good accuracy (as implemented in the notebook) and highlighted `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Fare` as top features.  
Visual and statistical analysis confirmed these trends consistently.

## Recommendations:
- Focus more on passenger demographics for survival prediction models in similar datasets.  
- For deployment, streamline the model using only the most important features to reduce complexity.  
- Address missing values early, especially in critical fields like `Age`, to maintain model integrity.  
- Further tune the model and validate with cross-validation to enhance performance.
